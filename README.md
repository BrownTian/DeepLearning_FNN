# DeepLearning FNN
This Repo representing some basic code for Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Build regression and classifier from scratch, only using autograd Library. Showing the way to code one of the most popular Neural Network model: Feedforward Neural Networks(Fully connected layers)

## Simple classification example for two class toy data
